# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EchoPay is a next-generation digital payments system that addresses the critical vulnerabilities in current instant digital payment systems. Unlike traditional platforms like Venmo, PayPal, or cryptocurrency systems, EchoPay introduces reversibility, traceability, and fraud protection without sacrificing transaction speed or user privacy. The system leverages Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or traceable smart money tokens to create a secure, auditable payment ecosystem that empowers users while maintaining compliance with regulatory frameworks.

The core innovation lies in EchoPay's ability to make digital payments both instant and reversible through smart token technology, real-time fraud detection, and a sophisticated arbitration system. This solves the fundamental problem where digital payments are irreversible, making users vulnerable to scams, fraud, and human error.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Smart Money Token System

**User Story:** As a payment system user, I want my digital currency to be traceable and auditable, so that fraudulent transactions can be identified and reversed when necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CBDC token is created THEN the system SHALL assign a unique identifier and metadata package to each token unit
2. WHEN a transaction occurs THEN the system SHALL record immutable transaction metadata including timestamp, parties, amount, and transaction context
3. WHEN tokens are transferred THEN the system SHALL maintain a complete audit trail while preserving user privacy
4. IF a token is involved in suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL flag it for enhanced monitoring without blocking legitimate use
5. WHEN regulatory compliance is required THEN the system SHALL provide auditable transaction histories without exposing personal user data

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Fraud Detection Engine

**User Story:** As a payment system operator, I want to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, so that I can prevent losses and protect users from scams.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction is initiated THEN the system SHALL analyze it against behavioral patterns within 100 milliseconds
2. WHEN anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL assign a risk score and trigger appropriate response protocols
3. WHEN graph analysis identifies suspicious networks THEN the system SHALL flag related accounts for enhanced monitoring
4. IF machine learning models detect fraud patterns THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate high-risk transactions
5. WHEN false positives occur THEN the system SHALL learn from user feedback to improve detection accuracy
6. WHEN fraud is confirmed THEN the system SHALL update ML models to prevent similar future attacks

### Requirement 3: Transaction Reversibility Framework

**User Story:** As a payment user, I want to report and reverse fraudulent transactions, so that I can recover my funds when I'm victimized by scams or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reports fraud THEN the system SHALL immediately freeze the disputed tokens and initiate investigation
2. WHEN clear fraud is detected THEN the system SHALL reverse the transaction within 1 hour
3. WHEN cases require arbitration THEN the system SHALL resolve disputes within 72 hours maximum
4. IF tokens are frozen THEN the system SHALL prevent their use while maintaining system liquidity
5. WHEN reversal is approved THEN the system SHALL reissue clean tokens to the victim and mark fraudulent tokens as invalid
6. WHEN reversal is denied THEN the system SHALL unfreeze tokens and restore normal transaction capability

### Requirement 4: User-Friendly Wallet Interface

**User Story:** As a payment user, I want an intuitive wallet interface that makes fraud reporting and transaction management simple, so that I can protect myself without technical complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the wallet THEN the system SHALL display transaction history with clear fraud reporting options
2. WHEN fraud is reported THEN the system SHALL guide users through a simple 3-step reporting process
3. WHEN disputes are active THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates and expected resolution times
4. IF reversals occur THEN the system SHALL maintain a complete reversal history for user reference
5. WHEN transactions are flagged THEN the system SHALL notify users with clear explanations and next steps
6. WHEN the interface is used THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-second response times for all user actions

### Requirement 5: High-Performance Transaction Processing

**User Story:** As a payment system user, I want transactions to process instantly at scale, so that the fraud protection doesn't compromise payment speed or reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are submitted THEN the system SHALL process them with sub-second latency
2. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain performance up to millions of transactions per day
3. WHEN fraud detection runs THEN the system SHALL operate asynchronously without blocking transaction flow
4. IF system components fail THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime through redundancy and failover
5. WHEN peak usage occurs THEN the system SHALL auto-scale to handle demand without degradation
6. WHEN maintenance is required THEN the system SHALL perform updates without service interruption

### Requirement 6: Compliance and Regulatory Integration (EchoNet)

**User Story:** As a regulatory authority, I want access to auditable transaction data for compliance purposes, so that I can ensure anti-money laundering and know-your-customer requirements are met without compromising user privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance queries are made THEN the system SHALL provide auditable data through secure APIs
2. WHEN KYC/AML checks are required THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing regulatory frameworks
3. WHEN ISO 20022 compliance is needed THEN the system SHALL support standard messaging formats
4. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate regulatory reports
5. WHEN audit trails are requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete transaction histories without exposing personal data
6. WHEN banks integrate THEN the system SHALL provide APIs that support existing compliance workflows

### Requirement 7: Privacy Protection and User Empowerment

**User Story:** As a payment user, I want my financial privacy protected while still benefiting from fraud protection, so that I can transact securely without surveillance concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions occur THEN the system SHALL protect user identity while maintaining auditability
2. WHEN fraud detection operates THEN the system SHALL analyze patterns without storing personal behavioral data
3. WHEN compliance is required THEN the system SHALL provide necessary data without enabling mass surveillance
4. IF privacy is compromised THEN the system SHALL immediately notify affected users and remediate the breach
5. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL comply while maintaining necessary audit trails
6. WHEN third parties access data THEN the system SHALL require explicit user consent and log all access

### Requirement 8: Global Scalability and Interoperability

**User Story:** As a global payment system operator, I want EchoPay to work across different CBDCs and payment networks, so that it can provide fraud protection for international transactions and humanitarian aid flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN different CBDCs are used THEN the system SHALL support cross-currency transactions with fraud protection
2. WHEN international transfers occur THEN the system SHALL maintain fraud detection across jurisdictions
3. WHEN humanitarian organizations use the system THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced transparency and accountability
4. IF regulatory requirements differ by region THEN the system SHALL adapt compliance features accordingly
5. WHEN new CBDCs are introduced THEN the system SHALL integrate them without service disruption
6. WHEN cross-border fraud occurs THEN the system SHALL coordinate with international authorities for resolution
