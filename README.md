# EchoPay Digital Payments System

EchoPay is a next-generation digital payments system that addresses critical vulnerabilities in current instant digital payment systems by introducing reversibility, traceability, and fraud protection without sacrificing transaction speed or user privacy.

## Architecture Overview

EchoPay is built as a distributed microservices system with the following core services:

- **Transaction Service** (Go) - High-speed transaction processing
- **Fraud Detection Service** (Python) - Real-time ML-powered fraud analysis  
- **Token Management Service** (Go) - CBDC token lifecycle management
- **Reversibility Service** (Java) - Fraud reporting and transaction reversal
- **Compliance Service** (Node.js) - Regulatory reporting and KYC/AML integration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.21+ (for Go services)
- Python 3.11+ (for fraud detection)
- Java 17+ (for reversibility service)
- Node.js 18+ (for compliance service)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd echopay
```

2. Start the infrastructure services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres redis kafka zookeeper
```

3. Start the monitoring stack:
```bash
docker-compose up -d prometheus grafana
```

4. Build and start all services:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### API Documentation

OpenAPI specifications are available in the `shared/apis/` directory:
- [Transaction Service API](shared/apis/transaction-service.yaml)
- [Fraud Detection API](shared/apis/fraud-detection.yaml)
- [Token Management API](shared/apis/token-management.yaml)
- [Compliance Service API](shared/apis/compliance-service.yaml)
- [Reversibility Service API](shared/apis/reversibility-service.yaml)

## Development

### Shared Libraries

The `shared/libraries/` directory contains common functionality:

- **errors**: Structured error handling with service context
- **logging**: Structured JSON logging with trace correlation
- **monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection
- **config**: Environment-based configuration management
- **http**: HTTP middleware and utilities
- **database**: PostgreSQL connection and migration utilities

### Data Models

Shared data models are defined in `shared/models/` using OpenAPI 3.0 specifications:
- **transaction.yaml**: Transaction data structures
- **token.yaml**: Smart token definitions
- **fraud-case.yaml**: Fraud detection and case management models

### Testing

Each service includes comprehensive testing:
