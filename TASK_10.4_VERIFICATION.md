- **Transaction Authorization Validation**: Ensures proper device-wallet authorization

### 3. Fraud Simulation with Multiple Devices
- **Coordinated Bot Network Detection**: Identifies device farms and automated fraud
- **Synthetic Identity Recognition**: Detects artificially created user profiles
- **Multi-Device Attack Patterns**: Recognizes coordinated attacks across devices
- **Real-Time Fraud Prevention**: Blocks fraudulent activities in real-time

### 4. Wallet Recovery and Device Re-registration
- **Secure Recovery Process**: Validates legitimate device recovery procedures
- **Fraudulent Recovery Prevention**: Blocks unauthorized recovery attempts
- **Emergency Wallet Freeze**: Tests emergency security procedures
- **Device Re-registration Security**: Ensures secure device replacement

### 5. Legitimate vs Fraudulent Pattern Recognition
- **Normal User Behavior Validation**: Recognizes and allows legitimate usage patterns
- **Fraud Pattern Identification**: Accurately identifies fraudulent behavior
- **Mixed Behavior Analysis**: Handles edge cases with both legitimate and suspicious activities
- **Machine Learning Accuracy**: Maintains high detection accuracy under various conditions

### 6. Performance and Load Testing
- **Concurrent Multi-Device Sessions**: Handles multiple simultaneous device sessions
- **High-Volume Device Registration**: Processes large numbers of device registrations
- **Real-Time Processing Performance**: Maintains sub-second response times
- **Fraud Detection Accuracy Under Load**: Preserves detection accuracy during high load
