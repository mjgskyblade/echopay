# Task 5.4 Verification: Real-time Risk Scoring and Decision Engine

## Task Overview
**Task**: 5.4 Build real-time risk scoring and decision engine
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Requirements**: 2.1, 2.4, 5.1

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Ensemble Risk Scoring System
✅ **Implemented** in `services/fraud-detection/src/models/risk_engine.py`

**Key Components:**
- `RiskScoreCalculator`: Combines ML model outputs with adaptive weighting
- Configurable model weights: behavioral (35%), graph (30%), anomaly (25%), rule-based (10%)
- Context-based score adjustments for amount, timing, velocity, and location
- Confidence calculation based on component score agreement

**Features:**
- Adaptive weighting based on transaction characteristics
- Performance-based weight adjustment
- Context-aware score modifications
- Confidence scoring for assessment reliability

### 2. Configurable Decision Engine
✅ **Implemented** in `services/fraud-detection/src/models/risk_engine.py`

**Key Components:**
- `DecisionEngine`: Rule-based decision making with configurable rules
- `DecisionRule`: Flexible rule definition with conditions and actions
- Priority-based rule evaluation
- Safe condition evaluation with restricted execution environment

**Default Rules:**
- Critical risk (≥0.9): BLOCK
- High risk (≥0.7): HOLD
- Large amounts + medium risk: HOLD
- New users + elevated risk: HOLD
- High velocity + elevated risk: BLOCK
- Medium risk (≥0.5): FLAG
- Low risk (<0.3): APPROVE

### 3. Real-time Model Inference
✅ **Implemented** with <100ms latency requirement

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
